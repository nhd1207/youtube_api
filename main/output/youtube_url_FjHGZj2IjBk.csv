Lunaals,I used to listen to this while I was a senior in high school, studying for the university exam. :&#39;) And now I&#39;m in my dream university. In fact, it&#39;s my second year in here now and I&#39;m still listening to this while studying for the midterms. Makes me really happy to think about how I was studying hard at that time and it was worth it. I love this music especially because it makes me feel nostalgic and thoughtful.. and also relaxed.,2022-10-30T13:57:38Z
Hea,I used to take deep breathes and try to match the beat of the song with my breathing when I was really stressed or anxious, or just overwhelmed mentally. The song always helped me calm down, or just get whatever emotion I need to get out. I&#39;m in a much better place now, I still need to come back to this song once in a while, but these days the song feels more like a warm reminder that I will always have this small corner of the internet by my side in my darkest place than an emergency helpline when no one is around. I&#39;m truthfully glad for that, thank you Monoman,2022-09-09T07:28:34Z

unadequated,To everyone who&#39;s studying with this music:<br>Checklist: <br>• A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate💧<br><br>• Your charger. You sometimes don&#39;t even notice that your device&#39;s battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time🔋<br><br>• Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it&#39;s a late night study session, you won&#39;t wake up anyone🎧<br><br>• a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.☕<br><br>• Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.⌨️<br><br>•Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 🐈<br><br><br>Reminder:After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it&#39;s cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. <br>You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that&#39;s even better than listening to music while reading the book.<br><br>I hope y&#39;all had a good day, if not, that&#39;s okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight <br><br>( This comment isn&#39;t originally mine, but I think it can help a lot of people :),2021-09-19T07:40:43Z

Jennah Raja,To anyone listening to this while being stressed from school, work, or whatever it might be:<br><br>At times you feel like giving up, don&#39;t you?<br>You question yourself with &quot;why am I putting in all this work and doing what I&#39;m doing?&quot;, right?<br>You have set such high expectations of yourself, haven&#39;t you?<br><br>It&#39;s so hard to focus especially since we are in the middle of a pandemic and at times we feel so unmotivated. You have so much to do and not enough time to do it. I get it. I feel you. It is not easy. It won&#39;t be easy.<br>While there are no shortcuts to completing your tasks or getting to your goals, just remember I am here for you and we have got this. Do not put yourself down and beat yourself up over everything. You need to take breaks. In between each assignment or task reward yourself. Talk to yourself. Open your window or go sit outside for a few minutes. Just breathe. Then, begin your work again. You must take breaks and collect yourself. Write down your thoughts. Drink some water.<br><br>Just remember you aren&#39;t the only one and you aren&#39;t alone. If we are struggling let&#39;s struggle together and get through the obstacles.<br><br>You are loved. Thank you for being here.<br><br>Good luck to everyone. Your hard work will pay off in the end.,2020-10-21T14:13:45Z

matchahamster,Dear MONOMAN, Recently my father passed away from cancer. During his final days, hospice suggested playing some relaxing music as he rested/family stayed by his side. He loved the guitar dearly, so we had this in the background. It brought so much comfort during such a painful time. Even now it soothes those who are left behind in grief. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for sharing such peace.,2020-06-18T19:21:32Z

Fransiska B,I have a fear of many things, even to present things in front of several people. My heart beats faster, my hands tremble, my mouth and brain can&#39;t work properly. In fact it&#39;s just being in an online meeting.Just a few days I was looking for some music or song that can calm me down while studying, and I found this again even though at first it was sad music for me (because it reminds me of a moment in the past) but that changes, this music brings its own serenity. And I found a way to be able to calm me down to face something that I&#39;m afraid of, namely while listening to this when I face it. Even though my hands are still shaking a little But at least I&#39;m calmer and my mouth is able to say something ..,2022-10-13T05:40:43Z

spidermonkey,Imagine yourself on your own little tropical island. <br><br>No rules, no schedules, no work, and no worries. <br><br>You’ve just finished catching fish and you decide to make a little campfire and cook your fish on the beach. <br><br>And after a long day you return to your little cabin on the beach with your belly full. <br><br>You stare out to the ocean to see the beautiful sun set. <br><br>Than as you step inside your little cabin it starts to rain a little, and you could hear every single rain drop land on your roof and on the windows. <br><br>As you start to doze off about all those little random thoughts in your brain, you bring out your guitar and play some tunes. <br><br>After your creative mind starts to get tired, your body begins to relax. <br><br>You walk up to your room and lay down in a comfy bed and think about the plans for the following day.<br><br>(EDIT)<br>Thank you for all the positivity. Hope you guys have a good day/ night. Be safe out there and happy new year ❤️,2021-01-11T11:58:47Z

Aaron Paul Orijuela,I just come accross to this again but I remember 3 years ago that I listen to this every early morning when I started working on myself and started a support role in my company.

Now I am managing my own team and awarded Top Team Manager for consecutive quarters. For those people who are working on something, tiny little effort up to the biggest sacrifice will pay-off someday. Good luck!,2022-11-03T09:34:49Z

Agnes Surya,It is so amazing how i see strangers trying to heal others through the comments section. You guys literally made my day. I hope everyone is having an amazing day💕<br>Remember guys, there is nothing that you can do to change your past. Humans make mistakes, all we can do is to forgive ourselves and be better. You are not disgusting, you are not ugly, you are WORTH IT, you are AMAZING, you are LOVED💕<br>Everything is gonna be just fine.,2021-01-14T09:26:23Z

My snowball,To everyone who&#39;s studying with this music:<br><br>Checklist: <br><br>• A bottle of water, at least 1liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate💧<br><br><br><br>• Your charger. You sometimes don&#39;t even notice that your device&#39;s battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time🔋<br><br><br><br>• Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones because it blocks background noises. Also, if it&#39;s a late-night study session, you won&#39;t wake up anyone🎧<br><br><br><br>• a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.☕<br><br><br><br>• Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone, a few pens, paper or whatever you need.⌨<br><br><br><br>•Anything else you could need, what about a heating pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 🐈<br><br><br><br><br><br>Reminder: After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it&#39;s cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. <br><br>You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that&#39;s even better than listening to music while reading the book.<br><br><br><br>I hope y&#39;all had a good day, if not, that&#39;s okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight 😴🧸<br><br><br><br>( This comment isn&#39;t originally mine, but I think it can help a lot of people :)  ),2022-03-27T15:01:03Z
